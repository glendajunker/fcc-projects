// arrays are variables that you can store multiple values inside of them

// to create an Array, it's recommended to give it a name that's plural.

const schedule = ['Wake up', 'Eat', 'Film a video', 'Watch things on Netflix']; // the "[]"" basically says to JS that we want to create an array.

const phoneNumbers = [5446841, 4945491, 78946545]

console.log(schedule);

console.log(phoneNumbers);
